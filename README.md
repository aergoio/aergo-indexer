# Aergo Metadata Indexer

This is a go program that connects to aergo server over RPC and synchronizes blockchain metadata with a database. It currently supports Elasticsearch and MySQL/MariaDB.

This creates the indices `block`, `tx`, and `name` (with a prefix). These are actually aliases that point to the latest version of the data.
Check [indexer/documents/documents.go](./indexer/documents/documents.go) for the exact mappings for all supported databases.

## Indexed data

Blocks
```
Field    Type        Comment
id       string      block hash
ts       timestamp   block creation timestamp
no       uint64      block number
txs      uint        number of transactions
size     uint64      block size in bytes
```

Transaction
```
Field          Type        Comment
id             string      tx hash
ts             timestamp   block creation timestamp
blockno        uint64      block number
from           string      from address (base58check encoded)
to             string      to address (base58check encoded)
amount         string      Precise BigInt string representation of amount
amount_float   f32         Imprecise float representation of amount, useful for sorting
type           string      "0" or "1"
category       string      user-friendly category
```

Names
```
Field    Type        Comment
id       string      name + tx hash
name     string
address  string      address (base58check encoded)
blockno  uint64      block in which name was updated
tx       string      tx in which name was updated
```

## Usage

```
Usage:
  indexer [flags]

Flags:
  -A, --aergo string       host and port of aergo server. Alternative to setting host and port separately.
  -T, --dbtype string      Type of database used (elastic, mariadb) (default "elastic")
  -E, --dburl string       Database URL (default "http://localhost:9200")
      --exit-on-complete   exit when reindexing sync completes for the first time
      --from int32         start syncing from this block number
  -h, --help               help for indexer
  -H, --host string        host address of aergo server (default "localhost")
  -p, --port int32         port number of aergo server (default 7845)
  -X, --prefix string      prefix used for index names (default "chain_")
      --reindex            reindex blocks from genesis and swap index after catching up
      --to int32           stop syncing at this block number (default -1)
```

Example

    ./bin/indexer -H localhost -p 7845 --dburl http://localhost:9200 --prefix chain_

You can use the `--prefix` parameter and multiple instances of this program to sync several blockchains with one database.

Instead of setting host and port of the aergo server separately, you can also pass them at once with `-A localhost:7845`.

To reindex (starting from scratch):

    ./bin/indexer --reindex

When reindexing, this creates new indices to sync the blockchain from scratch.
After catching up, the aliases are replaced with the new data and the old indices removed.
This means the old data can still be accessed until the sync is complete.
